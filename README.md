<div align=center>

A lyric player component library that aims to look similar to iPad version of Apple Music. With [DOM](./packages/core/README.md), [React](./packages/react/README.md) and [Vue](./packages/vue/README.md) bindings.

This is perhaps the most iPad Apple Music-like lyric page you've seen in frontend.

Although the goal of this project is not to imitate it completely, it will polish some details to be better than the current best lyric players.

## Performance configuration reference

Performance benchmarks have shown that mainstream CPU processors from the last five years can run the lyric component at 30FPS. However, if you need smooth 60FPS operation, ensure your CPU frequency is at least 3.0GHz or higher. For 144FPS or above, a CPU frequency of at least 4.2GHz is recommended.

GPU performance capable of running at full 60 fps at the expected sizes under the following conditions:

-   `1080p (1920x1080)`: NVIDIA GTX 10 series and above
-   `2160p (3840x2160)`: NVIDIA RTX 2070 and above
